I'm a full stack senior developer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include JavaScript, Flutter, C/C++ and Python. I recently created my own linux distro with open source project repo launched.  My interest in the leadership led me to launch team <a href="https://bsba.uz/">BSBA™</a>, a community for various type of developers where they exchange & sharpen their experiences.
